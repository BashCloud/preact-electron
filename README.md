# Preact-Photon Demo

Demonstration of a desktop app built with [Electron] using the light-weight [Preact] library, [npm] for package management, and [Babel] and [Webpack2] for compilation.

[Preact]: https://github.com/developit/preact
[Babel]: https://babeljs.io/
[Webpack2]: https://webpack.js.org/
[Electron]: http://electron.atom.io/

See [package.json](./package.json) for scripts and dependencies.

Repository based on [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).

## Usage

First, install [Yarn] for your system (you can replace `npm` with `yarn` below if you don't wish to switch yet)
- `npm install` Install dependencies.
- `npm run watch` Compile development version and watch for changes. Bundled files will appear in `dist/`.
- `npm start` Start the desktop app (while watcher is running in another terminal). Use Ctrl-R or Cmd-R to reload the app.
